# GameTools-Final-Project
Final Project (and supporting documentation) for Game Tools 2020

# Log

* Made the city bigger (more buildings)

* Created "racetrack" path through city

* Divided the city up with roads

* Made the racetrack more visually distinct from normal roads

* Randomised the building heights

* Building blocks now check to see if they're completely surrounded

* If a block is surrounded, its mesh doesn't render

* Designed and added new materials:
- Wood (Yellow, White, Green)
- Basic Tile (Yellow, White, Green)
- "Daisy" themed tiles
- "Sunflower" themed tiles
- "Poppy" themed tiles
- Racetrack tile
- Glass

* Created perlin noise texture for land outside city

* Created terrain assets, randomly distributed outside city 

* Randomised terrain object sizes

* Ensured 2D terrain objects are always facing towards the centre of the city

* Made 2D Tilemap Mountains around edge of scene

* Modelled a glass dome to go around the city

* Changed car controls (Now Add Force)

* Changed how camera works

* Fixed issue where the player "car" clips through objects
